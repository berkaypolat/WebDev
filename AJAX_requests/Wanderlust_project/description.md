# Project Wanderlust
- Using fetch, async, and await, we can request information from the Foursquare
API and APIXU to create a travel website.

- Should register for developer accounts for both of the APIs above. They’re both free.
For Foursquare, once you make an account, create a new app and fill out the form
(you can put any link in the “App or Company URL” field).

- The Foursquare API will then give a client ID and a client secret. APIXU will
give an API Key.
